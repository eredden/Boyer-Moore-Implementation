#  Searching Text & String Data

### Description

This project was created for the [Computer Science 201 course](https://study.com/academy/course/computer-science-201-data-structures.html) on [Study.com](https://study.com). This application allows the user to search for U.S. states which contain a given substring. The substring is searched for using the bad character rule of the Boyer-Moore algorithm. Occurrences of the substring are presented to the user. 

### Documentation

The functions of each of the options in the program are described in-depth below:

1. Display the text: The application displays the content of the text (i.e. the names of 50 states in the United States).
2. Search: The application prompts the user to input a part of the name of a state as a pattern for search. The application searches for the pattern in the text using the bad character rule of the Boyer-Moore algorithm. Then, the application displays the indices of the matches (i.e. occurrences of the pattern in the text).
3. Exit the program.
